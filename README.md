<h1> Deep Learning for Anti-Money Laundering: Detecting Suspicious Transactions </h1>

<h3>Team Members:Heba Bou KaedBey, Min Shi, Ritesh Bachhar, Khanh Nguyen </h3>

Dataset: The SAML-D dataset comprises 12 characteristics and 28 typologies, selected based on existing datasets, academic literature, and interviews with AML specialists, which highlights its broad applicability. It contains 9.5 million entries, however, the ``isLaundering" labels are highly imbalanced, with only 0.15\% representing actual money laundering activity. In addition, the data set includes 15 graphical network structures that model transaction flows within these typologies. Although some structures are shared between types, they differ significantly in parameters to increase complexity and challenge detection efforts.

Goal: Build a deep learning model on SAML-D to detect suspicious financial transactions, reducing false positives while improving recall in anti-money laundering systems. We also want to try using OpenAIâ€™a GPT to generate natural language explanations for each flagged transaction. And if time permits deploy to AWS ( probably S3).
