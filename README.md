# -Fraud-detection-using-Generative-AI

Dataset: PaySim which is publicly available synthetic dataset of mobile financial transactions.
Goal: We want to build a model that learns what normal transactions look like and flag anything suspicious as potential fraud using VAE. We also want to try using OpenAIâ€™a GPT to generate natural language explanations for each flagged transaction. And if time permits deploy to AWS ( probably S3).
